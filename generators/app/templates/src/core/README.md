# core

framework code that is not specific to this app goes here.

### Warning
This code is at the core of the framework, and should generally not be modified. 

however, it is provided locally to the scaffold so if the need arises, changes can be made more easily. Doing so is akin to an eject, so change at your own risk. This may become a separate npm module soon.
