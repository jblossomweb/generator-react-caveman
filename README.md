## Installation

Note: this is still under construction, and has not yet been submitted to the NPM repository.

So first, you will want to set up a local npm link. Clone this repository, install its dependencies, then link it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jblossomweb/generator-react-caveman.git
cd generator-react-caveman
npm install
npm link
```

Next, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-react-caveman using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
mkdir my-new-app
cd my-new-app
yo react-caveman
```
